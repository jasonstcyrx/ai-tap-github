The GitHub REST API is versioned. The API version name is based on the date when the API version was released. For example, the API version 2022-11-28 was released on Mon, 28 Nov 2022.
Any breaking changes will be released in a new API version. Breaking changes are changes that can potentially break an integration. Breaking changes include:

removing an entire operation
removing or renaming a parameter
removing or renaming a response field
adding a new required parameter
making a previously optional parameter required
changing the type of a parameter or response field
removing enum values
adding a new validation rule to an existing parameter
changing authentication or authorization requirements

Any additive (non-breaking) changes will be available in all supported API versions. Additive changes are changes that should not break an integration. Additive changes include:

adding an operation
adding an optional parameter
adding an optional request header
adding a response field
adding a response header
adding enum values

When a new REST API version is released, the previous API version will be supported for at least 24 more months following the release of the new API version.
For more information about API versions, see "API Versions."
Upgrading to a new API version
Before upgrading to a new REST API version, you should read the section on this page that corresponds to the new API version to understand what breaking changes are included and to learn more about how to upgrade to that API version.
When you update your integration to specify the new API version in the X-GitHub-Api-Version header, you'll also need to make any changes required for your integration to work with the new API version.
Once your integration is updated, test your integration to verify that it works with the new API version.
