The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Actions/SecretsREST API endpoints for GitHub Actions SecretsUse the REST API to interact with secrets in GitHub Actions.About secrets in GitHub Actions
You can use the REST API to create, update, delete, and retrieve information about secrets that can be used in workflows in GitHub Actions. Secrets allow you to store sensitive information, such as access tokens, in your repository, repository environments, or organization. For more information, see "Using secrets in GitHub Actions."List organization secretsLists all secrets available in an organization without revealing their
encrypted values.
