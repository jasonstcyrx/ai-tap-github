The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Actions/Self-hosted runnersREST API endpoints for self-hosted runnersUse the REST API to interact with self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions.About self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions
You can use the REST API to register, view, and delete self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. Self-hosted runners allow you to host your own runners and customize the environment used to run jobs in your GitHub Actions workflows.
