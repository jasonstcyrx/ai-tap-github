The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Actions/VariablesREST API endpoints for GitHub Actions variablesUse the REST API to interact with variables in GitHub Actions.About variables in GitHub Actions
You can use the REST API to create, update, delete, and retrieve information about variables that can be used in workflows in GitHub Actions. Variables allow you to store non-sensitive information, such as a username, in your repository, repository environments, or organization. For more information, see "Variables" in the GitHub Actions documentation.List organization variablesLists all organization variables.
