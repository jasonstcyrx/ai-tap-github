The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Activity/NotificationsREST API endpoints for notificationsUse the REST API to manage GitHub notifications.About GitHub notifications

These endpoints only support authentication using a personal access token (classic). For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens."

You can use the REST API to manage GitHub notifications. For more information about notifications, see "About notifications."
All calls to these endpoints require the notifications or repo scopes. You will need the repo scope to access issues and commits from their respective endpoints.
Notifications are returned as "threads".  A thread contains information about the current discussion of an issue, pull request, or commit.
Notifications are optimized for polling with the Last-Modified header.  If there are no new notifications, you will see a 304 Not Modified response, leaving your current rate limit untouched.  There is an X-Poll-Interval header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.

About notification reasons
These GET endpoints return a reason key. These reasons correspond to events that trigger a notification.
There are a few potential reasons for receiving a notification.





































































Reason NameDescriptionapproval_requestedYou were requested to review and approve a deployment. For more information, see "Reviewing deployments."assignYou were assigned to the issue.authorYou created the thread.commentYou commented on the thread.ci_activityA GitHub Actions workflow run that you triggered was completed.invitationYou accepted an invitation to contribute to the repository.manualYou subscribed to the thread (via an issue or pull request).member_feature_requestedOrganization members have requested to enable a feature such as Draft Pull Requests or Copilot.mentionYou were specifically @mentioned in the content.review_requestedYou, or a team you're a member of, were requested to review a pull request.security_alertGitHub discovered a security vulnerability in your repository.security_advisory_creditYou were credited for contributing to a security advisory.state_changeYou changed the thread state (for example, closing an issue or merging a pull request).subscribedYou're watching the repository.team_mentionYou were on a team that was mentioned.
Note that the reason is modified on a per-thread basis, and can change, if the reason on a later notification is different.
For example, if you are the author of an issue, subsequent notifications on that issue will have a reason of author. If you're then  @mentioned on the same issue, the notifications you fetch thereafter will have a reason of mention. The reason remains as mention, regardless of whether you're ever mentioned again.List notifications for the authenticated userList all notifications for the current user, sorted by most recently updated.Fine-grained access tokens for "List notifications for the authenticated user"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensThe token must have the following permission set:metadata:read and notifications:readParameters for "List notifications for the authenticated user"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Query parametersName, Type, Descriptionall boolean If true, show notifications marked as read.Default: falseparticipating boolean If true, only shows notifications in which the user is directly participating or mentioned.Default: falsesince string Only show results that were last updated after the given time.

]Mark notifications as readMarks all notifications as "read" for the current user. If the number of notifications is too large to complete in one request, you will receive a 202 Accepted status and GitHub will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as "read."

]Mark repository notifications as readMarks all notifications in a repository as "read" for the current user. If the number of notifications is too large to complete in one request, you will receive a 202 Accepted status and GitHub will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as "read." To check whether any "unread" notifications remain, you can use the List repository notifications for the authenticated user endpoint and pass the query parameter all=false.Fine-grained access tokens for "Mark repository notifications as read"This endpoint does not work with GitHub App user access tokens, GitHub App installation access tokens, or fine-grained personal access tokens.Parameters for "Mark repository notifications as read"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionowner string RequiredThe account owner of the repository.
