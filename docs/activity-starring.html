The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Activity/StarringREST API endpoints for starringUse the REST API to bookmark a repository.About starring
You can use the REST API to star (bookmark) a repository. Stars are shown next to repositories to show an approximate level of interest. Stars have no effect on notifications or the activity feed. For more information, see "Saving repositories with stars."
Starring versus watching
In August 2012, we changed the way watching
works on GitHub. Some API
client applications may still be using the original "watcher" endpoints for accessing
this data. You should now use the "star" endpoints instead (described
below). For more information, see "REST API endpoints for watching" and the changelog post.
In responses from the REST API, watchers, watchers_count, and stargazers_count correspond to the number of users that have starred a repository, whereas subscribers_count corresponds to the number of watchers.List stargazersLists the people that have starred the repository.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."
