A GitHub App installation refers to any user or organization account that has installed the app. For information on how to authenticate as an installation and limit access to specific repositories, see "Authenticating as a GitHub App installation."
To list all GitHub App installations for an organization, see "REST API endpoints for organizations."List repositories accessible to the app installationList repositories that an app installation can access.Fine-grained access tokens for "List repositories accessible to the app installation"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App installation access tokensThe token does not require any permissions.This endpoint can be used without authentication if only public resources are requested.Parameters for "List repositories accessible to the app installation"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Query parametersName, Type, Descriptionper_page integer The number of results per page (max 100).
