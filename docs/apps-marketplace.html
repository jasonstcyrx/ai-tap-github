The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Apps/MarketplaceREST API endpoints for GitHub MarketplaceUse the REST API to interact with GitHub MarketplaceAbout GitHub Marketplace
For more information about GitHub Marketplace, see "GitHub Marketplace."
These endpoints allow you to see which customers are using a pricing plan, see a customer's purchases, and see if an account has an active subscription.
Testing with stubbed endpoints
You can test your GitHub App with stubbed data. Stubbed data is hard-coded, fake data that will not change based on actual subscriptions.
To test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether the API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.
Make sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.Get a subscription plan for an accountShows whether the user or organization account actively subscribes to a plan listed by the authenticated GitHub App. When someone submits a plan change that won't be processed until the end of their billing cycle, you will also see the upcoming pending change.
