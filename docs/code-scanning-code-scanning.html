The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Code scanning/Code scanningREST API endpoints for code scanningUse the REST API to retrieve and update code scanning alerts from a repository.About code scanning
You can retrieve and update code scanning alerts from a repository. You can use the endpoints to create automated reports for the code scanning alerts in an organization or upload analysis results generated using offline code scanning tools. For more information, see "Finding security vulnerabilities and errors in your code with code scanning."List code scanning alerts for an organizationLists code scanning alerts for the default branch for all eligible repositories in an organization. Eligible repositories are repositories that are owned by organizations that you own or for which you are a security manager. For more information, see "Managing security managers in your organization."
The authenticated user must be an owner or security manager for the organization to use this endpoint.

}Delete a code scanning analysis from a repositoryDeletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.
You can delete one analysis at a time.
To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
When you list the analyses for a repository,
one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
"deletable": true

An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
for each enabled code scanning tool,
where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:

ref
tool
category

If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
you'll get a 400 response with the message:
Analysis specified is not deletable.

The response from a successful DELETE operation provides you with
two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
next_analysis_url and confirm_delete_url.
Use the next_analysis_url URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
for the specified tool in your repository.
Use the confirm_delete_url URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of next_analysis_url and confirm_delete_url
in the 200 response is null.
As an example of the deletion process,
let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
Then repeat the process for the second set.
The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
Outer loop:


List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.


Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
Inner loop:

Delete the identified analysis.
Parse the response for the value of confirm_delete_url and, if found, use this in the next iteration.



The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the confirm_delete_url value. Alternatively, you could use the next_analysis_url value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

}Upload an analysis as SARIF dataUploads SARIF data containing the results of a code scanning analysis to make the results available in a repository. For troubleshooting information, see "Troubleshooting SARIF uploads."
There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.

If you upload to a pull request, for example --ref refs/pull/42/merge or --ref refs/pull/42/head, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests."
If you upload to a branch, for example --ref refs/heads/my-branch, then the results appear in the Security tab for your repository. For more information, see "Managing code scanning alerts for your repository."

You must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using gzip, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:
gzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0

SARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.
To get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries. For more information, see "SARIF results exceed one or more limits."
