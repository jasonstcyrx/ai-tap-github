]Check if a user is a repository collaboratorFor organization-owned repositories, the list of collaborators includes outside collaborators, organization members that are direct collaborators, organization members with access through team memberships, organization members with access through default organization permissions, and organization owners.

Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "Rate limits for the API" and "Best practices for using the REST API."
Adding an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise administrators. For more information, see "Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise."
For more information on permission levels, see "Repository permission levels for an organization". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:
Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}

Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set Content-Length to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "HTTP method."
The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page, the email they receive, or by using the API.
Updating an existing collaborator's permission level
The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different permission parameter. The response will be a 204, with no other indication that the permission level changed.
Rate limits
You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.Fine-grained access tokens for "Add a repository collaborator"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensGitHub App installation access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token must have the following permission set:administration:writeParameters for "Add a repository collaborator"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionowner string RequiredThe account owner of the repository.

}Remove a repository collaboratorRemoves a collaborator from a repository.
To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must either be an administrator of the repository or target themselves for removal.
This endpoint also:

Cancels any outstanding invitations
Unasigns the user from any issues
Removes access to organization projects if the user is not an organization member and is not a collaborator on any other organization repositories.
Unstars the repository
Updates access permissions to packages

Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on forks:

If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.

Note: A user can still have access to the repository through organization permissions like base repository permissions.
Although the API responds immediately, the additional permission updates might take some extra time to complete in the background.

permissions are admin, write, read, and none.
Note: The permission attribute provides the legacy base roles of admin, write, read, and none, where the
maintain role is mapped to write and the triage role is mapped to read. To determine the role assigned to the
collaborator, see the role_name attribute, which will provide the full role name, including custom roles. The
