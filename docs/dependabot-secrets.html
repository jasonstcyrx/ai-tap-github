The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Dependabot/SecretsREST API endpoints for Dependabot secretsUse the REST API to manage Dependabot secrets for an organization or repository.About Dependabot secrets
You can create, update, delete, and retrieve information about encrypted secrets using the REST API. Secrets allow you to store sensitive information, such as access tokens, in your repository, repository environments, or organization. For more information, see "Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot."
These endpoints are available for authenticated users, OAuth apps, and GitHub Apps. Access tokens require repo scope for private repositories and public_repo scope for public repositories. GitHub Apps must have the dependabot_secrets permission to use these endpoints. Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read secrets.List organization secretsLists all secrets available in an organization without revealing their
encrypted values.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the admin:org scope to use this endpoint.Fine-grained access tokens for "List organization secrets"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensGitHub App installation access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token must have the following permission set:organization_dependabot_secrets:readParameters for "List organization secrets"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionorg string RequiredThe organization name.
