The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Deployments/EnvironmentsREST API endpoints for deployment environmentsUse the REST API to create, configure, and delete deployment environments.About deployment environments
For more information about environments, see "Using environments for deployment." To manage environment secrets, see "REST API endpoints for GitHub Actions Secrets."
Environments, environment secrets, and deployment protection rules are available in public repositories for all current GitHub plans. They are not available on legacy plans, such as Bronze, Silver, or Gold. For access to environments, environment secrets, and deployment branches in private or internal repositories, you must use GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise. If you are on a GitHub Free, GitHub Pro, or GitHub Team plan, other deployment protection rules, such as a wait timer or required reviewers, are only available for public repositories.List environmentsLists the environments for a repository.
Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint.
