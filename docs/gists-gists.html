The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Gists/GistsREST API endpoints for gistsUse the REST API to list, create, update and delete the public gists on GitHub.About gists
You can use the REST API to view and modify gists. For more information about gists, see "Editing and sharing content with gists."
Authentication
You can read public gists  anonymously, but you must be signed into GitHub to create gists. To read or write gists on a user's behalf, you need the gist OAuth scope and a token. For more information, see "Scopes for OAuth apps."
Truncation
The API provides up to one megabyte of content for each file in the gist. Each file returned for a gist through the API has a key called truncated. If truncated is true, the file is too large and only a portion of the contents were returned in content.
If you need the full contents of the file, you can make a GET request to the URL specified by raw_url. Be aware that for files larger than ten megabytes, you'll need to clone the gist via the URL provided by git_pull_url.
In addition to a specific file's contents being truncated, the entire files list may be truncated if the total number exceeds 300 files. If the top level truncated key is true, only the first 300 files have been returned in the files list. If you need to fetch all of the gist's files, you'll need to clone the gist via the URL provided by git_pull_url.List gists for the authenticated userLists the authenticated user's gists or if called anonymously, this endpoint returns all public gists:Fine-grained access tokens for "List gists for the authenticated user"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token does not require any permissions.Parameters for "List gists for the authenticated user"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Query parametersName, Type, Descriptionsince string Only show results that were last updated after the given time.
