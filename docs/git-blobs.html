The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Git database/BlobsREST API endpoints for Git blobsUse the REST API to interact with a Git blob (binary large object), the object type used to store the contents of each file in a repository.About Git blobs
A Git blob (binary large object) is the object type used to store the contents of each file in a repository. The file's SHA-1 hash is computed and stored in the blob object. These endpoints allow you to read and write blob objects
to your Git database on GitHub. Blobs leverage these custom media types. For more information about the use of media types in the API, see "Getting started with the REST API."Create a blobFine-grained access tokens for "Create a blob"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensGitHub App installation access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token must have the following permission set:contents:writeParameters for "Create a blob"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionowner string RequiredThe account owner of the repository.

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw blob data.
application/vnd.github+json: Returns a JSON representation of the blob with content as a base64 encoded string. This is the default if no media type is specified.
