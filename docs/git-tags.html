The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Git database/TagsREST API endpoints for Git tagsUse the REST API to interact with tag objects in your Git database on GitHub.About Git tags
A Git tag is similar to a Git reference, but the Git commit that it points to never changes. Git tags are helpful when you want to point to specific releases. These endpoints allow you to read and write tag objects to your Git database on GitHub. The API only supports annotated tag objects, not lightweight tags.Create a tag objectNote that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then create the refs/tags/[tag] reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to create the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.
Signature verification object
The response will include a verification object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the verification object:






























NameTypeDescriptionverifiedbooleanIndicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified.reasonstringThe reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below.signaturestringThe signature that was extracted from the commit.payloadstringThe value that was signed.
These are the possible values for reason in the verification object:
