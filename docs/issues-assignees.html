The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Issues/AssigneesREST API endpoints for issue assigneesUse the REST API to manage assignees on issues and pull requests.About issue and pull request assignees
You can use the REST API to view, add, and remove assignees on issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like managing assignees, labels, and milestones, are provided within the Issues endpoints.List assigneesLists the available assignees for issues in a repository.Fine-grained access tokens for "List assignees"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensGitHub App installation access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token must have at least one of the following permission sets:issues:readpull_requests:readThis endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.Parameters for "List assignees"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionowner string RequiredThe account owner of the repository.
