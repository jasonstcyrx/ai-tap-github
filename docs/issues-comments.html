The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Issues/CommentsREST API endpoints for issue commentsUse the REST API to manage comments on issues and pull requests.About issue and pull request comments
You can use the REST API to create and manage comments on issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like managing assignees, labels, and milestones, are provided within the Issues endpoints. To manage pull request review comments, see "REST API endpoints for pull request review comments."List issue comments for a repositoryYou can use the REST API to list comments on issues and pull requests for a repository. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.
By default, issue comments are ordered by ascending ID.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
