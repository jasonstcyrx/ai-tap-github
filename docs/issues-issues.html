The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Issues/IssuesREST API endpoints for issuesUse the REST API to manage issues and pull requests.List issues assigned to the authenticated userList issues assigned to the authenticated user across all visible repositories including owned repositories, member
repositories, and organization repositories. You can use the filter query parameter to fetch issues that are not
necessarily assigned to you.
Note: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull
request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

]List repository issuesList issues in a repository. Only open issues will be listed.
Note: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull
request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

}Get an issueThe API returns a 301 Moved Permanently status if the issue was
transferred to another repository. If
the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API
returns a 404 Not Found status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read
access, the API returns a 410 Gone status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe
to the issues webhook.
Note: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull
request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

Note: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull
request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
