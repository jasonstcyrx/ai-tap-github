The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Issues/LabelsREST API endpoints for labelsUse the REST API to manage labels for repositories, issues and pull requests.About labels
You can use the REST API to manage labels for a repository and add or remove labels to issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like managing assignees, labels, and milestones, are provided within the Issues endpoints.List labels for an issueLists all labels for an issue.Fine-grained access tokens for "List labels for an issue"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensGitHub App installation access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token must have at least one of the following permission sets:issues:readpull_requests:readThis endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.Parameters for "List labels for an issue"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionowner string RequiredThe account owner of the repository.
