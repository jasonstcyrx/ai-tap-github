The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Issues/TimelineREST API endpoints for timeline eventsUse the REST API to receive events triggered by timeline activity in issues and pull requests.About timeline events
You can use the REST API to view different types of events triggered by timeline activity in issues and pull requests. For more information about the specific events that you can receive, see "Issue event types." To view GitHub activity outside of issues and pull requests, see "GitHub event types."
You can use timeline events to display information about issues and pull requests or determine who should be notified of issue comments.
Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like managing assignees, labels, and milestones, are provided within the Issues endpoints.List timeline events for an issueList all timeline events for an issue.Fine-grained access tokens for "List timeline events for an issue"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensGitHub App installation access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token must have at least one of the following permission sets:issues:readpull_requests:readThis endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.Parameters for "List timeline events for an issue"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionowner string RequiredThe account owner of the repository.
