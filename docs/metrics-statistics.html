The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Metrics/StatisticsREST API endpoints for repository statisticsUse the REST API to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.About repository statistics
You can use the REST API to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.
Best practices for caching
Computing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached
data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's
statistics, you'll receive a 202 response; a background job is also fired to
start compiling these statistics. You should allow the job a short time to complete, and
then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a
200 response with the statistics in the response body.
Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.
Statistics exclude some types of commits
The statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by different repository graphs.
To summarize this:

All statistics exclude merge commits.
Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.
Get the weekly commit activityReturns a weekly aggregate of the number of additions and deletions pushed to a repository.
