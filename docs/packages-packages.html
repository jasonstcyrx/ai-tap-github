The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Packages/PackagesREST API endpoints for packagesUse the REST API to interact with GitHub Packages.About GitHub Packages
GitHub Packages supports a range of package managers for publishing packages. For more information, see "Introduction to GitHub Packages."
After you publish a package, you can use the REST API to manage the package in your GitHub repositories and organizations. For more information, see "Deleting and restoring a package."
To use the REST API to manage GitHub Packages, you must authenticate using a personal access token (classic).

To access package metadata, your token must include the read:packages scope.
To delete packages and package versions, your token must include the read:packages and delete:packages scopes.
To restore packages and package versions, your token must include the read:packages and write:packages scopes.

If your package is in a registry that supports granular permissions, then your token does not need the repo scope to access or manage this package. If your package is in a registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, then your token must also include the repo scope since your package inherits permissions from a GitHub repository. For a list of registries that only support repository-scoped permissions, see "About permissions for GitHub Packages."Get list of conflicting packages during Docker migration for organizationLists all packages that are in a specific organization, are readable by the requesting user, and that encountered a conflict during a Docker migration.

You can restore a deleted package under the following conditions:

The package was deleted within the last 30 days.
The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.
