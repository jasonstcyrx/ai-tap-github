The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Rate limit/Rate limitREST API endpoints for rate limitsUse the REST API to check your current rate limit status.About rate limits
You can check your current rate limit status at any time. For more information about rate limit rules, see "Rate limits for the REST API."
The REST API for searching items has a custom rate limit that is separate from the rate limit governing the other REST API endpoints. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for search." The GraphQL API also has a custom rate limit that is separate from and calculated differently than rate limits in the REST API. For more information, see "Rate limits and node limits for the GraphQL API." For these reasons, the API response categorizes your rate limit. Under resources, you'll see objects relating to different categories:


The core object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.


The search object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see "REST API endpoints for search."


The code_search object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching code. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for search."


The graphql object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API.


The integration_manifest object provides your rate limit status for the POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions operation. For more information, see "Registering a GitHub App from a manifest."


The dependency_snapshots object provides your rate limit status for submitting snapshots to the dependency graph. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for the dependency graph."


The code_scanning_upload object provides your rate limit status for uploading SARIF results to code scanning. For more information, see "Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub."


The actions_runner_registration object provides your rate limit status for registering self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for self-hosted runners."

Some categories of endpoints have custom rate limits that are separate from the rate limit governing the other REST API endpoints. For this reason, the API response categorizes your rate limit. Under resources, you'll see objects relating to different categories:

The core object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.
The search object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see "Search."
The code_search object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching code. For more information, see "Search code."
The graphql object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API. For more information, see "Resource limitations."
The integration_manifest object provides your rate limit status for the POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions operation. For more information, see "Creating a GitHub App from a manifest."
The dependency_snapshots object provides your rate limit status for submitting snapshots to the dependency graph. For more information, see "Dependency graph."
The code_scanning_upload object provides your rate limit status for uploading SARIF results to code scanning. For more information, see "Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub."
The actions_runner_registration object provides your rate limit status for registering self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. For more information, see "Self-hosted runners."
The source_import object is no longer in use for any API endpoints, and it will be removed in the next API version. For more information about API versions, see "API Versions."

Note: The rate object is deprecated. If you're writing new API client code or updating existing code, you should use the core object instead of the rate object. The core object contains the same information that is present in the rate object.Fine-grained access tokens for "Get rate limit status for the authenticated user"This endpoint works with the following token types:GitHub App user access tokensGitHub App installation access tokensFine-grained personal access tokensThe token does not require any permissions.This endpoint can be used without authentication if only public resources are requested.HTTP response status codes for "Get rate limit status for the authenticated user"Status codeDescription200OK304Not modified404Resource not foundCode samples for "Get rate limit status for the authenticated user"Request exampleget/rate_limitcURLJavaScriptGitHub CLIcurl -L \
