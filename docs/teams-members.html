The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning."REST API/Teams/MembersREST API endpoints for team membersUse the REST API to create and manage membership of teams in your GitHub organization.About team members
These endpoints are only available to authenticated members of the team's organization. OAuth access tokens require the read:org scope. GitHub generates the team's slug from the team name.

Note: When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API to make changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "Managing team synchronization for your organization."
List pending team invitationsThe return hash contains a role field which refers to the Organization Invitation role and will be one of the following values: direct_member, admin, billing_manager, hiring_manager, or reinstate. If the invitee is not a GitHub member, the login field in the return hash will be null.

Note:

}Add or update team membership for a userAdds an organization member to a team. An authenticated organization owner or team maintainer can add organization members to a team.
Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see GitHub's products in the GitHub Help documentation.
Note: When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub."
An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team.
If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.
Note: You can also specify a team by org_id and team_id using the route PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}.Parameters for "Add or update team membership for a user"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionorg string RequiredThe organization name.

To remove a membership between a user and a team, the authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the organization that the team is associated with. Removing team membership does not delete the user, it just removes their membership from the team.
Note: When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization.
