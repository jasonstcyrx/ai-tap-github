]Check team permissions for a repositoryChecks whether a team has admin, push, maintain, triage, or pull permission for a repository. Repositories inherited through a parent team will also be checked.
You can also get information about the specified repository, including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom media type via the application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json accept header.
If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a 404 Not Found response status.
If the repository is private, you must have at least read permission for that repository, and your token must have the repo or admin:org scope. Otherwise, you will receive a 404 Not Found response status.
Note: You can also specify a team by org_id and team_id using the route GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}.Parameters for "Check team permissions for a repository"HeadersName, Type, Descriptionaccept string Setting to application/vnd.github+json is recommended.Path parametersName, Type, Descriptionorg string RequiredThe organization name.
