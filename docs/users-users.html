]Get a userProvides publicly available information about someone with a GitHub account.
The email key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your GitHub profile page. When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be “public” which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for email, then it will have a value of null. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub. For more information, see Authentication.
The Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly.
