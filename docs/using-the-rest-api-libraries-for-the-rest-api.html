REST API/Using the REST API/LibrariesLibraries for the REST APIYou can use the official Octokit libraries and other third-party libraries to extend and simplify how you use the GitHub API.In this articleAbout librariesOfficial GitHub librariesThird-party librariesAbout libraries
You can use libraries to extend and simplify the way your application interacts with GitHub's API. Each library provides pre-built code for a specific programming language. After integrating a library into your project, you can use the pre-built code modules to interact with GitHub's API via a specific programming language.
GitHub maintains official Octokit libraries for some languages. There are also third-party libraries that you can use with GitHub's API, which are not maintained by GitHub.
