This is a high-level JSON schema that outlines the structure for the GitHub App installation access token endpoints. It has a top-level "actions" and "activity" properties, each containing nested objects for the respective endpoints in those categories. 

The schema defines the expected properties like "endpoint" (the URL path), "method" (HTTP method), "headers", and "response" schema. You would need to fill in the actual values for each endpoint definition based on the API documentation.

Note that I have only included a few example endpoints under "actions" and "activity" for brevity. You would need to add all the remaining endpoints documented in the "Authentication endpoints available for GitHub App installation access tokens" section.
